# Evans Theatre Eleventy

Convert the Evans Theatre website from WordPress to Eleventy.

Current version: 1.0.0.

## Todo
- [ ] Header Info
- [ ] 3 post types: Movie, Page, and News Article
- [x] Yearly list of Movies - see https://darekkay.com/blog/eleventy-group-posts-by-year/
      - [ ] Order by year, then by showtimes
- [ ] News archive
- [ ] Hero images for Movies (and maybe the other post types too)
- [ ] Media queries
- [ ] Compartmentalized `.eleventy.js` file (`include`/`require` other files?)
- [ ] **Contact Us** form
- [ ] As little client-side JS as I can get away with
- [ ] That said: [search](https://rknight.me/using-pagefind-with-eleventy-for-search/)
- [ ] Date formatting
- [ ] Comments? (probably not) Webmentions? (maybe) @see https://sia.codes/posts/webmentions-eleventy-in-depth/

...boy, I'm not asking half much, am I?
