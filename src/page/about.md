This is the Evans Theatre, Brandon's indiest indie cinema. We show movies most weekend from September to the end of April. We're all volunteers here, and we'd love to have you join us!

## How to Find Us

We're on the campus of Brandon University, in the John E. Robbins Library building. Here's a map:
