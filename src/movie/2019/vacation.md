In memory of projectionist Richard Hunt, we present one of his favourite movies: *National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation*.

It's Christmas time and the Griswolds are preparing for a family seasonal celebration, but things never run smoothly for Clark, his wife Ellen and their two kids. Clark's continual bad luck is worsened by his obnoxious family guests, but he manages to keep going knowing that his Christmas bonus is due soon.

**Note:** Our original intent was to show *Vacation*; however, due to factors beyond our control, this is not possible.
