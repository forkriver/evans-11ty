It is January 2011, before the Arab Spring begins to take hold in Syria. Adib Abdel Kareem (Alexander Siddig) had made the perfect life for himself in Toronto: beautiful wife, two grown daughters, great job. He is a confident man, at ease in any setting – his Syrian background betrayed only by a slight accent and his daughters’ names, Muna and Leila. Adib is a man who has successfully built a life from scratch – a man who had left his past behind. Until his daughter, Muna, disappears in Damascus and his past catches up to him all at once. Twenty-five years ago, Adib, a promising young officer in the Syrian military police, suddenly left Damascus under suspicious circumstances. He left his entire life behind, including the love of his life, Fatima (Marisa Tomei). He made his way to Canada and wiped the slate clean. He never told anyone about his past. So when his daughter Muna, a young freelance photographer, decided to visit Damascus on a whim, she had no idea what she was walking into. As soon as he learns of her disappearance, Adib knows he is the only one who can get her out. He returns to retrace Muna’s steps through Syria – a closed and paranoid police state. He enlists the help of Fatima and then Paul, a Canadian Consular official (Joshua Jackson) who knows more than he lets on. In order to find his daughter, he must confront the past that he left behind.
