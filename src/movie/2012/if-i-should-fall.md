***Special eventÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one show only, all box-office proceeds to charity.***

In March of 2009, 22-year old Trooper Marc Diab of The Royal Canadian Dragoons was killed in Afghanistan when his vehicle struck an IED (Improvised Explosive Device). In the wake of his death, countless lives were changed forever. *If I Should Fall* tells the story of MarcÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life through the accounts of those who loved him: his family, his comrades of D Squadron, and his beloved girlfriend.

Told in 13 chapters and going beyondÃ‚Â the six oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢clock news, viewers see the human face behind the honour and sacrifice of soldiers.
