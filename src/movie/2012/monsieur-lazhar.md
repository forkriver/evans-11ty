Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Philippe Falardeau (*Congorama*, *It's Not Me, I Swear!*) and from the producers of last year's Academy Award-nominated *Incendies, Monsieur Lazhar* is one of the most gripping Quebecois films of the last decade. The film has already received extraordinary attention, including **Best Canadian Feature Film** at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival as well as being named Canada's foreign language film submission to the 84<sup>th</sup> Annual Academy Awards. Following the tragic and shocking death of a Montreal schoolteacher, Bachir Lazhar (Fellag) - a middle-aged Algerian immigrant seeking political refuge in Quebec - swiftly pursues the opportunity to fill the sudden vacancy and come to the aid of the overworked principle and students affected by this tragedy. To these children in shock, Lazhar's traditional teaching methods may well provide the structure they need. As more information about Lazhar's own history is revealed, his struggles and experiences make him all the better suited to guide these children into adulthood. *Monsieur Lazhar* is further proof of Falardeau's talent for drawing out depth and precision from child actors. The fine performances reflect the authenticity of the characters, and the story illustrates how adult hypocrisy and little white lies about death can turn a child's world upside down when fate strikes. A complex character study of loss, innocence and imposture, *Monsieur Lazhar* is a resplendent and tender tale about the lessons we learn from one another, regardless of age. Bachir has much to gain from his pupils, and so do we.
