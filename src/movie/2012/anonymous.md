For decades, scholars and intellectuals have debated a question that haunts the history of English literature: were the works of William Shakespeare written by Shakespeare himself? Theories abound Ã¢â‚¬â€&#157; some credit ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plays to famed contemporaries Francis Bacon and Christopher Marlowe Ã¢â‚¬â€&#157; but the reigning true author among Shakespeare revisionists remains Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. De VereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation as a highly skilled poet and playwright, and his close ties to Queen Elizabeth I, place him at the centre of a controversy that has altered the way many view both a literary legacy and the history of the English royal court. Premiering at the 2011 Toronto International Film FestivalÃ‚Â®, Roland EmmerichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historical thriller *Anonymous* takes the question of Shakespearean authorship and weaves it into the story of the Essex Rebellion in the court of Elizabeth I. Emmerich Ã¢â‚¬â€&#157; best known for blockbusters such as *The Patriot* and *Independence Day* Ã¢â‚¬â€&#157; sees the story of de Vere as part of the larger scheme of political intrigue, romantic scandal and betrayal that threatened ElizabethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reign even in its final years. Recreating seventeenth-century London with the full arsenal of cinematic magic at his disposal, Emmerich crafts a complex historical world against which the most salacious drama of the period plays out. Emmerich and screenwriter John Orloff take the mysterious circumstances of de VereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s birth, as well as the rumours surrounding his possible affair with Queen Elizabeth, as the motivation behind the playwrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place as a political tool in the Essex plot to claim the throne. Rhys Ifans (*Greenberg*, *Enduring Love*) Ã¢â‚¬â€&#157; an indispensible supporting player in so many films Ã¢â‚¬â€&#157; makes a star turn as de Vere, matched by a cast of renowned English actors that includes both Vanessa Redgrave (*Coriolanus*, *The Whistleblower*) and her daughter Joely Richardson (*The Affair of the Necklace*), as Queen Elizabeth, David Thewlis (*War Horse*, *The Lady*) as the scheming William Cecil, Rafe Spall (*One Day*, *Hot Fuzz*) as a brash young Shakespeare and Derek Jacobi *(The KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Speech*, *Gosford Park*), who delivers the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prologue from a contemporary London theatre. An ambitious period film from a highly-skilled director, *Anonymous* takes audiences back to a time when the London stage was a political battlefield on which dramas greater than the plays themselves were acted out by some of the most powerful figures in English history.
