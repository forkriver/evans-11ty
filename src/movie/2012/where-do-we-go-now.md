Set in a remote village where the church and the mosque stand side by side, *Where Do We Go Now?* follows the antics of the town's women to keep their blowhard men from starting a religious war. Women heartsick over sons, husbands and fathers lost to previous flare-ups unite to distract their men with clever ruses, from faking a miracle to hiring a troupe of Ukrainian strippers.
