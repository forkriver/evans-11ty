A Gala Presentation at the 2010 Toronto International Film FestivalÃ‚Â®, and based on Tatiana de RosnayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestselling novel of the same name, *SarahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Key* is a fictionalized account of the actual roundups in Paris that sentenced thousands of Jewish families to their deaths. Starring Kristin Scott Thomas (*Nowhere Boy, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Loved You So Long*), the film is a harrowing and profoundly moving tale about a terrible period of French history. In the summer of 1942, ten-year-old Sarah Starzynski (MÃƒÂ©lusine Mayance) knows something is wrong. There is a panic spreading through the city. The French gendarmes, supposedly under order from the Vichy government and Nazi occupiers, are going door-to-door arresting Jewish families and imprisoning them in the VÃƒÂ©lodrome d'Hiver. Little does Sarah know that, after the imprisonment, they will be sent to Nazi death camps. In an attempt to save her family, she locks her four-year-old brother, Michel in a bedroom cupboard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ their secret hiding place. She promises to return for him, but she and her parents are dragged from their home forever. Sixty years later, journalist Julia Jarmond (Scott Thomas) is assigned to write a cover story on the VelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Hiv roundup of 1942. American by birth, Julia has been living in Paris for more than twenty years, and is married to Bertrand TÃƒÂ©zac (FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric Pierrot), an unfaithful man from an old French bloodline. What begins as research for her article becomes more personal when Julia discovers that she and Sarah have something in common, prompting her to change her outlook on her husband, her adopted nation and herself. Evocatively shot, with a solid ensemble cast lead by a pitch-perfect Scott Thomas, *SarahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Key* provides a realistic and morally complex approach to history that is as captivating as it is unforgettable.
