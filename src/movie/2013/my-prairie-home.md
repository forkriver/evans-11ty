Transgender musician and performer Rae Spoon is crossing endless fields of wheat and a famously big sky in Chelsea McMullan’s documentary-musical, *My Prairie Home*. All along the way—in a Greyhound bus, the Tyrell Dinosaur Museum in Drumheller, a bar in Regina, a performance in Winnipeg—McMullan’s camera is a constant companion. As the flat, straight Prairie highway unfolds, McMullan guides us on the long and winding road of Spoon’s life. This playful, meditative and at times melancholic tale of Spoon’s queer and musical coming of age unfolds in interviews and in songs, in live performance and in fanciful music sequences. Spoon takes us through their childhood growing up in an ultra-religious family, discovering their sexuality, their gender identity, and the crucial and inspiring leaps towards building a life of their own, as a musician and as a trans person. As Spoon says, gazing out a Greyhound window, “You can’t be where you’re going yet, and you can’t be where you left. You’re in this in-between space.” There will be a performance by Rae before the film and a Q&amp;A with them to follow.
