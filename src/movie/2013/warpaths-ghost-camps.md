*One night only: a special premi√®re event.*This, the second episode in the *Warpaths* documentary series, sheds more light on how Canadians trained in the Great War and on what life in the training camps was like for our soldiers. The sacrifices made by Canadians in the First World War are marked by the graves all along their warpaths. It was moving to tell the story of the Canadians who died on their way to the Front, or while waiting to come home. We hope Ghost Camps will help keep their stories alive. The show will be followed by a Q&amp;A with the filmmakers. After that, we will show Part 1 of the series -- *Warpaths: Every Town Had Soldiers*, for those that couldn't make it to last year's showing.
