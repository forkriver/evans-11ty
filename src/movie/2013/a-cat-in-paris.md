Dino is a pet cat that leads a double life. By day he lives with Zoe, a little mute girl whose mother, Jeanne, is a detective in the Parisian police force. But at night he sneaks out the window to work with Nico - a slinky cat burglar with a big heart, whose fluid movements are poetry in motion - as he evades captors and slips and swishes from rooftop to rooftop across the Paris skyline. The cat's two worlds collide when young Zoe decides to follow Dino on his nocturnal adventures - and falls into the hands of Victor Costa, a blustery gangster planning the theft of a rare statue.Now cat and cat burglar must team up to save Zoe from the bumbling thieves, leading to a thrilling acrobatic finale on top of Notre Dame. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7e07c52VWg
