These three films were produced by [Turtle Mountain - Souris Plains Heritage Association](https://www.vantagepoints.ca/) through a partnership between municipalities and with the Manitoba Metis Federation – South West Region. They emphasize a shared love of the land and a desire for their communities to cooperate into the future. For more info on TMSPHA, see [their website at vantagepoints.ca](https://vantagepoints.ca/) or find them on Facebook. 

## *Precious Load: Tales of a Turtle Mountain Trapper*

*Precious Load: Tales of a Turtle Mountain Trapper* is a story of rescue.  It also contributes to a retelling of Manitoba history. We get to know T. T. Racine as he speaks to us compellingly of his Metis forebears managing Turtle Mountain to keep food on their tables. Precious Load is about a man working in the woods, coming across three young girls, lost, cold and anxious as mid winter darkness descends. TT knows that it was the mountain that led him to find the girls. He attributes his family's preservation of the trapping lifestyle for his being in the right place that night.  

Director-producer, Julie Watt, loved this story into existence. She was tasked with creating a film about local history to be usable in schools. When the tale of the girls came to her, she knew she had a great story. The Metis community embraced her and the film emerged.

## *The Chain Lakes Barn*

*The Chain Lakes Barn* is a love story between a magnificent farmyard barn and its successive families. Now, in its old age, the barn reflects on the transitions it has experienced and Jon, the present owner-farmer of the land and barn, bares his heart regarding a difficult choice he has to make. Does he repair the old barn; a barn his farming operation no longer needs, or does he tear it down to create something new? Jon literally caresses the support beams of his old friend as he tells stories about growing up in its sheltering space.

This film contributes to TMSPHA's body of work, that of retelling South West Manitoba history. TMSPHA wants to be honest and inclusive about 10,000 years of human history in the area. They want to create a renewed history that is accessible to youth, teachers, citizens and decision makers throughout, and beyond, the region. 

This is the second film Julie Watt has thoughtfully produced and directed for TMSPHA. Street Media provided the filming and editing. 

## *Whitewater: The Beauty and the Challenge*

Whitewater Lake is beautiful. But it's also a challenge for municipal decision makers and for farmers around its shores. This short film employs the voice of the lake itself as it pulls in friends to help tell of its history and of its relationship with its watershed – the north slope of Turtle Mountain. Her friends include farmers, a Metis trapper, a municipal councilor, local history buffs and a retired conservation official. Whitewater makes it clear that she, as the lake, does not cause the flooding. She and her friend, the mountain, point to a more cooperative and holistic solution to the challenge of flooding. The film captures the beauty of the lake and its impressively grand south west Manitoba landscape.    

This film was expertly produced and directed by Street Media in Brandon.
