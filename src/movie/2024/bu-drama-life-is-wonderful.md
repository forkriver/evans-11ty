The classic holiday film *It's A Wonderful Life* gets an exciting re-vamp in Brandon University Theatre's latest production. If you enjoyed last season's *Salt-Water Moon*, you are sure to be entertained by this heart-warming production.

Set in a fictional Manitoba town, *Life Is Wonderful* is the story of George Bailey, a kind-hearted man whose dreams of leaving his small town are thwarted by unfortunate twists of fate. On Christmas Eve, a financial disaster threatens to ruin him, and George contemplates ending his life. Enter Clarence, an "angel-in-waiting" tasked with renewing George's faith in life.

Every human has a profound effect on the lives of the people they touch. Every life, no matter how ordinary, is extraordinary. No person is a failure who has friends. These are the central themes of *Life Is Wonderful.*

*While this show is intended for family audiences, please be aware that* Life Is Wonderful *has scenes containing violence and discussion of suicidal thoughts.*
