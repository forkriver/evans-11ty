Evans Theatre
April 4,5,6 7pm
Matinee April 6 2pm

Tickets $5-$20 - cash at the door](https://evanstheatre.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SWM-Banner-final.jpeg)](https://evanstheatre.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SWM-Banner-final.jpeg)</figure>This heartfelt exploration of young love is a Canadian classic. First staged by Tarragon Theatre, Toronto, in 1984, it has been produced numerous times in North America and the world since its premiere. It won the Canadian Authors Association Literary Award for Drama, the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding New Play, the Hollywood Drama-Logue Critics’ Award, and was a finalist for the Governor-General’s Award for Drama.

David French is one of Canada’s most critically-acclaimed and widely-produced playwrights. He was born in Coley's Point, the setting of the play, in 1939. Although French moved from Newfoundland to Toronto with his family as a child, his fascination with his birthplace was present in many of his plays. In Salt-Water Moon, two young people question the restrictions society places on them, as they ponder their future. Yes, it is a love story, but Salt-Water Moon is also about breaking the binds of traditional expectations in the pursuit of happiness.

Our cast and production crew are made up entirely of Brandon University students. The cast includes Alison Gray, Kristen Fortune, Charlotte Whidden, Jim Mussellam, Jackson Hacault, Jordan Smithson and Tyler Paramor. The production is directed by Rochelle Douris, MFA, a drama instructor at Brandon University with over twenty years' directing experience in Canada and the U.S.
