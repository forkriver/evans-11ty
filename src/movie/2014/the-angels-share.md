The wayward and disillusioned Robbie sneaks into the maternity hospital to visit his young girlfriend and hold his newborn son for the first time. Overwhelmed by the moment, he swears that his son will not have the same tragic life he has had.

Escaping a prison sentence by the skin of his teeth, he's given one last chance, and while serving a community service order he meets three others who, like him, find it impossible to get work because of their criminal records. The four friends embark on an adventure and discover that turning to drink might just change their lives -- not cheap fortified wine, but the best malt whiskeys in the word.

But will it be 'slopping out' for the next twenty years, or a new future with 'Uisce Beatha' -- the 'Water of Life'? Only the angels know...
