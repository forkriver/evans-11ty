<div class="overview" dir="auto">In search of a new perspective, a family of five leave the comforts of home to live remotely in the Yukon wilderness during the long northern winter and amidst the surprises that the rawness of nature provide. The parents leave their jobs and take their three children, ages 10, 8 and 4, to spend nine months living in a small cabin with no road access, no electricity, no running water, and no internet, no TV, no phone and, most importantly, no clocks or watches. Filmed over 9 months, off the grid, without external crew, and featuring the unique perspectives of children, *All The Time In The World* explores the theme of disconnecting from our hectic and technology laden lives in order to reconnect with each other, ourselves and our natural environment â€“ parents connecting with children, children connecting with nature. </div>
