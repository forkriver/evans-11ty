<div class="overview" dir="auto">A widower, Philippe lives with his teenage daughter in a luxurious Paris apartment. When a paragliding accident leaves him paralyzed from the neck down, Philippe requires a caregiver to assist him with his daily physical needs. With the help of his assistant Magalie (Audrey Fleurot, *The Women on the Sixth Floor*) he interviews a number of highly qualified candidates, all of whom he subsequently rejects in favour of Driss, a recently released ex-con who has only applied for the job to ensure he keeps getting welfare payments. Charmed by Driss’s brash self-confidence and sometimes brutal straightforwardness, the jaded Philippe finds the young man’s lack of pity precisely what he wants in a caregiver. Thus begins an unlikely pairing, one of which will change both their lives in a remarkable ways. </div>*French with English subtitles.*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RqDiYnFxTk
