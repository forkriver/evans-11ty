*Wheat City: 1930s: A prairie town in the era of the Great Depression* portrays the experience of Brandonites and their institutional leaders in an era of local, national and international crisis wrought by the circumstances of the Great Depression. The crisis pushed the city to the brink of bankruptcy, left many dependent on municipal authorities for survival, forced the reconstitution of Brandon College, and galvanized the town’s political life around issues of survival individual and corporate. Through the depression era stories of mostly anonymous drifters, Communist militants Joe, Pat, and Stan Forkin, maverick municipal politician Harry Cater, Brandon College Principal J.R.C. Evans\*, Brandon businessman A.E. McKenzie, and the youthful Walter “Turk” Broda -- to name a few -- this documentary explores the social, economic, political crisis of the Great Depression at the level of a prairie town in southwestern Manitoba. ## Special Event -- Friday, Oct. 17

Tom Mitchell (producer &amp; writer) and Craig Cesmystruk (director) will be in attendance, and will do a Q&amp;A after the show. Bring questions! \_\_\_\_ \* For whom the Evans Theatre is named.
