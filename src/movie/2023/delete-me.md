Oh hi, delete this movie, there's no there there.

## Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

Leela's gonna kill me. File not found. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

1. Why not indeed!
2. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
3. Who are you, my warranty?!

### Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
