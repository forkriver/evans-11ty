# The Last Bus

After his wife Mary passes on, widower Tom uses a free bus pass to travel the length of Britain. He goes from John O’Groats in Scotland to Land’s End in Cornwall—the shared birthplace­ of Tom and Mary—using only local buses. During this nostalgic, incident-filled trip, his encounters with local people make him a media phenomenon. Tom is totally unaware of his new celebrity until he arrives at Land’s End.
