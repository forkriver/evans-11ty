## Warpaths: Every Town Had Soldiers

*Warpaths: Every Town Had Soldiers* is a broadcast-length documentary, featuring the stories of three men from Western Manitoba who fought for Canada during the First World War. This community-expression documentary was produced by Street Media Inc. and is written and hosted by The RCA Museum Director, Marc George.

Filming for this project took place in the spring and summer of 2012 and features many locations throughout the Westman area including the Town of Boissevain, Camp Hughes Provincial Heritage Site and The RCA Museum in Shilo. The filmmakers also traveled to France, following the footsteps of the Westman soldiers who fought for their country in the iconic Battle of Vimy Ridge.
