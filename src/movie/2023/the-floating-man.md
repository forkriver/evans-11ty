[Michael V. Smith](http://www.michaelvsmith.com/), award winning Canadian writer and poet, has a new film out, [The Floating Man](https://vimeo.com/813378820/52256d419b), which has just won the Director's Choice award at the [Cinema Diverse Film Festival](https://psculturalcenter.org/filmfest/about-cinema-diverse).

This intimate documentary unpacks Michael V. Smith's journey as a self-described sissy with a body he found humiliating as he developed his art to become a radical drag performer and genderqueer artist. A unique blend of DIY documentary, road trip, performance art, and videopoem, this amusing self-portrait sources Smith's provocative art practice to examine a lifetime of untrue stories about his body. One featured project includes Smith on a road trip on British Columbia's Sunshine Coast, searching for famed Canadian singer Joni Mitchell, while dressed as Peanut the Clown.
