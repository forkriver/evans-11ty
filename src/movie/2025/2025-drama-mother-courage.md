Brandon University Theatre presents a unique, contemporary take on Bertolt Brecht's powerful anti-war play, *Mother Courage And Her Children* at the Evans Theatre. Student actress **Alycia Oleson** plays Mother Courage, a single mother who fights to feed her family and keep them alive in wartime. The show incorprorates music, satire and a multi-media backdrop to create a provocative portrait of war and its devastating outcomes.

Set to the music of synth-pop pioneers Kraftwerk, Devo and Depeche Mode, BU's production is not set during any particular war, instead combining visual elements from centuries of global conflict. The cast includes **Carley Poloski** as Mother Courage’s mute daughter, Kattrin, **Malvin Anh Duc Tran** as eldest son Eilif, and **Logan Baker** as younger son, Swiss Cheese. Filling out the principal cast are **Mae Bartolome** as the Voice of the People, **Rafael Palma** as the Voice of War, **Noah Kanski** as Cook Nilsson, and **Charles Adamu** as Chaplain Gothus.
