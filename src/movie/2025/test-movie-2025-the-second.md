Like a broken clock that can't tell time, 
like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes,
like a scorching blaze that burned the sand,
like a band that planned and planned and planned
and flew down like a raven in the dark of night
and snatched up the worm helpless to fight
and brought it back to the nest, singing microphone check

One two one two, this is just a test  
One two one two, this is just a test  
One two one two, this is just a test
