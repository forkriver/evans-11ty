Officer Sandra Perron resigns from the Canadian military after a controversial photo surfaces. Adapting to civilian life amidst an investigation, she denies abuse allegations despite evidence suggesting mistreatment within her unit.

*Based on a true story.*

## Panel Discussion

On Saturday, Nov. 29th, there will be a panel discussion following the movie, featuring special guests:

- **Major Melissa Marshall**  
  Chief of Staff at CFB Shilo, Artillery officer 
- **Major Kristen MacFadyen**  
  Commanding Officer, 11 Health Services Centre at CFB Shilo, Medical Administrator, and "Champion" of the Shilo Defence Women's Advisory Group

The topic of discussion will be Maj. Marshall's and Maj. MacFayden's personal perspectives on being a woman in the Canadian Armed Forces and how things have changed from what is portrayed in the film. The situation for women in the CAF *had* to change, because of what is portrayed in the film, and it has.
