A conservative plumber from a small East Coast village travels to Toronto to get his brother out of jail after he is arrested for having sex with another man in a public park. At the insistence of their strong-willed mother, the two brothers must drive the 1000 mile trip back home to New Brunswick, togetherâ€”discovering each other and themselves along the way.
