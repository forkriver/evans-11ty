A Valentine tradition: *The Rocky Horror Picture Show* will play the Evans on Feb. 13th at 10 PM. In this cult classic, sweethearts Brad (Barry Bostwick) and Janet (Susan Sarandon), stuck with a flat tire during a storm, discover the eerie mansion of Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite scientist. As their innocence is lost, Brad and Janet meet a houseful of wild characters, including a rocking biker (Meat Loaf) and a creepy butler (Richard O'Brien). Through elaborate dances and rock songs, Frank-N-Furter unveils his latest creation: a muscular man named "Rocky." *This is a special event in conjunction with [Brandon Pride](https://www.facebook.com/Brandon-Pride-253055741525984/).*
