*This is a special event, presented by the [Brandon University Women's Collective](http://www.busu.ca/collectives/). Standard Evans pricing and passes may not apply. **Note the earlier time.***“Hush” is the result of an unusual team looking honestly at a highly sensitive and controversial topic. To properly handle the subject matter has required more care than transporting nitroglycerin… but an explosion is inevitable. Since the supreme court’s decision of Roe vs Wade legalized abortion in 1973, “pro-choice” people and “pro-life” people have been arch-enemies. Pure hatred for one another’s viewpoints has reigned even to the point of physical violence towards one another. So when “pro-choice” Director Punam Kumar Gill and “pro-life” Producer Joses Martin began conversations about the subject of the health effects of abortion on women, we weren’t sure whether such a partnership would be possible. But we believed that if we could overcome our differences and work together, the outcome would be powerful towards the breaking down of political boundaries. Together we determined to maintain one goal, and only one goal, in the making of this film: to find the truth for the sake of women’s health. To do this, we would have to maintain a posture of honour towards ALL women, forgoing our personal opinions of whether abortion is right or wrong, good or bad. We united for the greater good: to ensure that the best possible care is being given to women. In “Pro-Life” circles, hearing about the negative effects of abortion is a common thing. Churches and Crisis Pregnancy Centres will tell you about the psychological trauma, potential for physical damage, and even breast cancer, that abortion may cause. On the other hand, in “Pro-Choice” circles, and at abortion clinics it is commonly told that the procedure is much safer than childbirth, that the psychological effects are the same as if you deliver the child, and the breast cancer connection is a closed case. One way or another, someone is lying to women.
