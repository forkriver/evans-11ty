Directed by six-time Academy Award (R) nominee Peter Weir, *The Way Back* is an epic story of survival, solidarity and indomitable human will. Shot in Bulgaria, Morocco and India, the film stars Jim Sturgess (*Across the Universe*, *The Other Boleyn Girl*), Ed Harris (*Appaloosa*) and Colin Farrell (*In Bruges*) as prisoners of a Soviet Union labor camp, who, along with four others, flee their Siberian Gulag and begin a treacherous journey across thousands of miles of hostile terrain. Academy AwardÃ‚Â®Ã‚Â nominee Saoirse Ronan (*Atonement*, *The Lovely Bones*) and Mark Strong (*Body of Lies*, *RocknRolla*) co-star. Written by Weir and Keith Clarke, the film is Peter's first since 2003's *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World*. It is inspired by the acclaimed book *The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom*, as well as first-person accounts and anecdotes as told to, and researched by Weir and executive producer Clarke.
