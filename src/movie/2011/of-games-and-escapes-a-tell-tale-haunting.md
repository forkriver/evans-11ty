Two Manitoba film-makers in a single weekend! Ã‚Â *Of Games and Escapes*Ã‚Â is Brandon-born Winnipegger Bevan Klassen's latest film, and the short *A Tell-Tale Haunting*Ã‚Â comes to us from Brandonite Chris Beyette.

## Of Games and Escapes

Winnipeg director Bevan KlassenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s *Of Games and Escapes* unfolds like a mystery story. Patrick McBride is a serious man who dreams of making a difference in the world but feels trapped by his sales job. As a creative outlet he creates a board game that expresses his view of the world. However as Patrick isolates himself he descends into his tormented mind, reaching an unexpected exit. The film is a psychological drama about an individual searching for meaning and acceptance in a toxic world formed by his own thoughts. http://youtu.be/\_Sb0VF\_qS-M [Official Site](http://ofgamesandescapes.com/)## A Tell-Tale Haunting

A lonely rancher kills his neighbour by accident. Instead of alerting the authorities, he hides the body. As the neighbour's brother and the police come asking about the missing man, he denies the truth, only to become haunted by his guilt and his victim. http://youtu.be/mrFqIxfCxsQ
