# Blood Quantum

We can’t screen this in our theatre this Halloween, but our programmer *really* wanted to. We recommend you check out *Blood Quantum* on a digital platform.

It’s a Canadian zombie plague movie with a near all-Indigenous cast that is quite appropriate for our time. Support Canadian film!
