<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">[![She Kills Monsters poster](https://i0.wp.com/evanstheatre.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/she-kills-monsters.jpg?resize=640%2C989)](https://i0.wp.com/evanstheatre.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/she-kills-monsters.jpg)</figure>In this high-octane dramatic comedy laden with homicidal fairies, nasty ogres, and five-headed dragons, acclaimed playwright Qui Nguyen offers a heart-pounding homage to the geek within us all. Two years after the death of her teenage sister Tilly, Agnes Evans discovers a mysterious notebook containing her sister’s home-brewed Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Newly born hero, Agnes the Ass-hatted, undertakes an epic quest to save Tilly’s soul and to learn about her sister’s hidden life.
