*Whispers in the Wheat* is a crime thriller follows a young man’s journey to finish the heist his father died trying to complete.

Andrew Milton travels to a secluded farm in search of a valuable painting that was buried by his estranged father twenty years earlier.

Under the alias of a farm hand, Andrew begins his search but complications arise when he meets Janice, who alters his focus.

Unbeknownst to Andrew, James, the leader of the household, is also looking for the painting. Andrew has actually been hired to uncover for James what he himself has set out to find.

Tensions reach a boiling point when a discovery is made that has violent consequences.
