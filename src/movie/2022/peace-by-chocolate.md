# Peace by Chocolate

After fleeing war-torn Lebanon after the family’s chocolate factory is bombed, Tareq Hadhad and his Syrian family immigrate to the small town of Antigonish in Canada. Tareq’s father Issam starts making chocolates again that are a hit at the local church, neighborly Frankrounds up local investors for a new factory, while local chocolatier Kelly feels threatened by the rivalry. While Issam’s “Peace By Chocolate” business continues to grow, Tareq is torn between his dream of becoming a doctor and his obligation to the family business.
