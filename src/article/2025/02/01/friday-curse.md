We've been having a string of issues on Friday evenings. We're hopeful that we've got everything sorted out. This weekend—Jan. 31 to Feb. 2—we *will* be showing movies on Saturday and Sunday.

Let's all cross our fingers for next Friday, too.

Thanks, everyone, for your patience. See you at the movies.
