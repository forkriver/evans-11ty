With the coming switch to digital projection, the Evans Theatre (and the Brandon Film Festival Inc., the non-profit corporation which presents movies at the Evans) faces a significant challenge. In as little as a year, we will be unable to show films in the traditional sense; all movies will be delivered on digital media, rather than on film. Our projection system will be obsolete. There is a significant cost to a digital conversion. We face a fundraising challenge in the neighbourhood of $80,000.00. That's a lot of money, especially for a small theatre in a small city in a small province. We need help. We're not just standing still; we're looking into all possible options, including grants, corporate sponsorship, and donations. The Brandon Film Festival Inc., by the way, is a registered charity, able to provide tax receipts for donations received. We really enjoy showing films to the people of Brandon and Westman; we'd love to be able to continue to do so. Please consider a donation, if you're able.
