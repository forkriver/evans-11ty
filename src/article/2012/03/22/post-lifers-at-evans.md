The Brandon Film Festival will be screening a short live action comedy/mockumentary film with Brandon connections. *The Post-Lifers* depicts a zombie infestation from the zombies' perspective. The film is the creation of Darren Hutchings, Greg Kovacs, Brad McMillan and Nathan Hawkins. Hutchings was born and raised in Brandon (with a little time in Neepawa) and is an alumnus of [Brandon University](http://www.brandonu.ca/). Kovacs lived in Brandon in the mid-80's where he and Hutchings became life-long friends. Another friend from Brandon settled in Kitchener, Ontario and married McMillan. The trio explored their love of film and film-making and, with the help of Hawkins, have brought *The Post-Lifers* to life. The Brandon Film Festival is proud to be a showcase for emerging film talent from Manitoba. We strive to bring independent, foreign, Canadian, documentary, and just plain good film to Brandon. "The Post-Lifers" will be screened the weekend of March 30 â€“ April 1 along with the feature length film *Carnage* at the Evans Theatre on the campus of Brandon University. Tickets are $6 at the door. Showtime is 7:30pm. For further information about *The Post-Lifers*, contact Darren Hutchings at: [d\_hutchings@hotmail.com](mailto:d_hutchings@hotmail.com) or by phone at [416-623-8107](tel:416-623-8107).
