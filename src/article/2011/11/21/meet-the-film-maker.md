Local film-makers are featured the weekend of December 2-4. Bevan Klassen will be at the theatre Friday Dec 2 to talk about his new feature film OF GAMES AND ESCAPES. Chris Beyette will join us Saturday Dec 3 to talk about the premiere of his new short film A TELL TALE HAUNTING. Both of these award-winning film-makers call Brandon home. Learn about how they made their films and the state of film-making in Manitoba. We are very excited to be able to show these films. Be amongst the first audiences to see them!
