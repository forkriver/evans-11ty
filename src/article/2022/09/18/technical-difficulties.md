Sigh.

We're ready; you're ready; but apparently our projector has hit the snooze button, looking for a couple more weeks of rest.

We've run into a bit of a snag with our projection system, and unfortunately we won't be able to show movies on the date we'd hoped. We're working hard behind the scenes to get everything sorted out, and are planning for a new start date of **October 14, 2022**. Our plan is to shift out movie dates forward on the calendar, but we need to make sure that still works with our film booking partners, and so we're pulling down our schedule for now.

We know you were looking forward to this; we sure were, too. We'll be sure to keep everyone updated. Watch this space!

See you at the movies (even if it's a little later in the year than we'd all hoped).
