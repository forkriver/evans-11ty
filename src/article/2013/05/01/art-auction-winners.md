Thank you all for your participation in our fundrasing auction. Your support toward our updgrade is very much appreciated.

Here are the winning bidders: **Cartwright** - Kim Bright **Elkhorn** - Community Futures Westman inc. **Elgin** - Community Futures Westman Inc. **Lyleton** - Julianne Kniskern **Napinka** - Community Futures Westman Inc. **Neepawa** - Community Futures Westman Inc. **Pipestone** - Community Futures Westman Inc. **Melita** - Community Futures Westman Inc. **Hartney** - Brandon Dental Centre **Brandon CPR** - Wayne Harrison **Brandon CNR/Prince Edward** - Brandon Dental Centre **Brandon CNR/Prince Edward** - Cando Contracting *Note:* For the benefit of the Evans Fundraising - Lois made available a second CNR print! Our heartfelt thanks to Lois Washington for contributing the works of William Hobbs. With out these prints our goal would be much further away. We haven't met our $90,000 goal yet but are now at half way point as a result of recently successful grants, public donations &amp; the Hobbs Auction. In just 7 months the public &amp; grants have allowed us to raise a staggering $45,000. Unbelievable support from our audience has proven that Brandon wants the Evans to continue on .
