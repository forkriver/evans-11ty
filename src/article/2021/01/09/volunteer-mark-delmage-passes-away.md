We are very saddened to say that Mark Delmage, our friend, fellow volunteer, teacher, pilot, mentor and familiar face of the Evans Theatre, died on Friday, January 8.

Mark was part of the Brandon Film Festival family for nearly 50 years and led from the front, taught by the side, and pushed us from behind. Both as a teacher at St Johns Ravenscourt and as a leader in the 82nd Air Squadron (Air Cadets), he was dedicated to making better men and women of the youth in his charge. He had no children of his own but there are many who have been taught as if they were.

Mark was an extremely dedicated projectionist, and while his heart beat with the tempo of the old film projectors, he embraced the new technology. He was key to helping the Evans enter the new digital era.

We miss him greatly, and when there is time in the future for us to get together safely and remember him, we will.

A tribute memorial movie in Mark's honour will be arranged at the Evans theatre at a future date.

You may leave a note in honour of Mark on [Brockie Donovan's site](https://brockiedonovan.funeraltechweb.com/tribute/details/7845/Mark-Delmage/obituary.html#tribute-start).

Until then, stay home, stay safe, and weâ€™ll see you at the movies.
